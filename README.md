Testing 3 ML models on the same dataset to see the most reliable one: Support Vector Machine, Logistics Regression Model, Naive Bayes

Result:

        LGM (92) > SVM (90) > NB (89)

        LGM (82) > SVM (81) > NB (80)

**Possible explanation**: Logistic Regression aligns with Occamâ€™s Razor, which suggests that, for a given problem, the simplest model is often the most effective when there are no specific assumptions in the data. Since our dataset does not rely on assumptions, Logistic Regression, being a straightforward model, is well-suited to achieve effective results here.
