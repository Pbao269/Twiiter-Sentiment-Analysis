Testing 3 ML models on the same dataset to see the most reliable one: Support Vector Machine, Logistics Regression Model, Naive Bayes

Result: LGM > SVM > NB

Possible explanation: Logistic Regression aligns with Occamâ€™s Razor, which suggests that, for a given problem, the simplest model is often the most effective when there are no specific assumptions in the data. Since our dataset does not rely on assumptions, Logistic Regression, being a straightforward model, is well-suited to achieve effective results here.
